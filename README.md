What?
=====

If you have a particularly huge Visual Studio solution then loading it up can be quite a pain and really slow down your development time.

Solution generator will take some project names and generate a solution file that includes all their project dependencies so that you can just work with an isolated set.

Usage
=====

```
gem install solution-generator
```

```
solution-generator <solution_name> <project_name> <project_name> <project_name>
```
